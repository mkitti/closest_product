# Closest Product Python Twitter ChallengeÂ¶
https://twitter.com/loicaroyer/status/1146173537658404864

Given a list of integers u=[a_0, ..., a_m] find the set of indices {i_0, ..., i_n} for that list such that the product u[i_0] ... u[i_n] is the closest to a given integer N. The shortest and most #elegant solution wins. (standard libs allowed)

Included here are the [Jupyter notebook](royer_closest_product.ipynb), [HTML export](royer_closest_product.html), and [python code](royer_closest_product.py).
